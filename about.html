        <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <img src="/aboutphoto.jpeg">
        <p>Hello, my name is Ben Foster. I am an Information Technology 
            Asssociate located in New York City. I recently left the US Army
            in pursuit of a career in IT. My passion for security has driven 
            me towards earning my CompTIA Security+ certification as a launching
            point for my career. While I mainly work in Network Administration now,
            I enjoy learning about network and security engineering, risk mitigation,
            disaster response, and software development.
        </p>
        <p>I'm originally from Eau Claire,
            Wisconsin, but I moved out to New York to attend the United
            States Military Academy at West Point. After graduating with a
            BS in Organizational Psychology and Leadership, I commissioned
            as a Second Lieutenant in the Army and soon became a Platoon
            Leader. Although my Army career came to a quicker close that I would've liked
            I am very grateful for the experiences I had and the people I met While
            I was in. I hope to take the lessons I learned about professional development, 
            leadership, and character into the private sector as I grow in my IT
            skills and improve the organizations I find myself a part of.</p> 
            <p>However, as
            much as my professional pursuits are governed by the effort I put into 
            the process, my motivation comes in greatest part from my small family with my 
            wife Jill and our dog Winston! Without them, I would not have the drive 
            for success that I do and the support to make it all happen. I love them dearly
            and I get confidence in my daily life from their love and God's love.
