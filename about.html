        <img src="">
        <p>Hello, my name is Ben Foster. I am an Information Technology 
            Asssociate located in New York City. I recently left the US Army
            in pursuit of a career in IT. My passion for security has driven 
            me towards earning my CompTIA Security+ certification as a launching
            point for my career. While I mainly work in Network Administration now,
            I enjoy learning about network and security engineering, risk mitigation,
            disaster response, and software development.
        </p>
        <p>I'm originally from Eau Claire,
            Wisconsin, but I moved out to New York to attend the United
            States Military Academy at West Point. After graduating with a
            BS in Organizational Psychology and Leadership, I commissioned
            as a Second Lieutenant in the Army and soon became a Platoon
            Leader.</p>
